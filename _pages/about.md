I am currently a (2nd year) PhD student in [LIX laboratory](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/) at École polytechnique. 

Before that, I did a [master degree](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php) in computer science at Ecole normale supérieure Paris-Saclay, and a [master degree](https://master-math-fonda.imj-prg.fr/) in fundamental mathematics at Sorbonne université. Here is my [CV](files/cv.pdf) for more details.

I'm mainly focused on the interface between algebraic topology and type theory. My goal is to construct cellular resolutions of groups in the setting of homotopy type theory ; this implies the use of [higher rewriting techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00429), as well as geometric models of groups (such as [this one](https://analysis-situs.math.cnrs.fr/La-variete-hypercubique.html) for instance). On this site you can find my research papers for more detail. Feel free to contact me if you share common interests !

You will as well find some other things here. [🐱](files/cat.JPG)
