I am a PhD student in [LIX laboratory](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/) at École polytechnique. I'm mainly focused on algebraic topology and type theory. My goal is to construct cellular resolutions of groups in the setting of homotopy type theory ; this implies the use of [higher rewriting techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00429), as well as geometric models of groups (such as [this one](https://analysis-situs.math.cnrs.fr/La-variete-hypercubique.html) for instance).

On this site you can find my research papers, as well as other things [🐱](files/cat.JPG)
